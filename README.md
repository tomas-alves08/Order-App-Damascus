# eJam: A Fullstack Application

---

## Goal Of The Application

This application will provide a list of open mic events to the public. The open mic venues can be fetched by searching for a name of a town in New Zealand. The result of the search will return a list of open mic venues. The user can then click on any of the listed venues to find all the relevant information about that event such as the name of the venue, address, frequency, date and time it happens and also possible musical instruments available.
The application allows users, once logged in, to create new open mic events. Only the user who created the event can update or delete the existent event.
